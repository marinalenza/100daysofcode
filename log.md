# **100 Days of Code**

### **Day 1**

- Setup git and github for the 100 days of code project
- Start C++ for Programmers Course at Udacity
- Simple program of logical statements
- Review for now: I think this course was made for programmers that had a background in Python, my background is mainly C, so for now nothing new. I like the short and direct videos and the quizzes are very helpful.
- I am trying to compile everything on the terminal and remote upgrade

### **Day 2**

- If Else Program, simple but nice
- I had some problems with git, but I look for the error online and found the solution ("It alredy exists a git repository of this directory", the solution was to remove the gitlock file)
