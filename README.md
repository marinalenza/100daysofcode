#### *100 Days of Code Challenge*

I am adapting the 100 days of code challenge:

1. I don't use twitter, so my commit will be only in github

2. My main target is C++ and Python

3. Main applications in algorithms, graphical interfaces, embedded systems and machine learning

4. I will be learning by tutorials on Udacity, Udemy, Medium, books and other websites

5. Journal on *log.md*
